# "CUBIX" ðŸ§Š
# Rubik's Cube Solver 

A C++ project to scan, represent, and solve a Rubikâ€™s Cube using multiple solver algorithms and efficient cube representations. This project includes a real-time camera scanner, various cube representations, and multiple solving strategies, including the IDA* solver using Korfâ€™s Algorithm.

# ðŸ“š Terminology

Cubie: One of the 26 mini-cubes of a Rubikâ€™s Cube, can have 1, 2, or 3 colored sides.

Center Cubie: 6 center cubies, one per face, always fixed.

Edge Cubie: 12 cubies with two colored sides.

Corner Cubie: 8 cubies with three colored sides.

Face: A side of the cube with 9 cubies (1 center, 4 edges, 4 corners).

ðŸ”„ Operations and Notation

Clockwise rotation: F, R, U, B, L, D

Counter-clockwise (prime) rotation: F', R', U', B', L', D'

Double rotation: F2, R2, U2, B2, L2, D2

18 possible moves:

F, Fâ€™, F2, U, Uâ€™, U2, L, Lâ€™, L2, D, Dâ€™, D2, R, Râ€™, R2, B, Bâ€™, B2

### ðŸ–¥ Cube Representations

3D Array Representation: cube[6][3][3] stores the colors of each face.

1D Array Representation: cube[54] sequentially stores all stickers for fast access.

Bitboard Representation: Each face is a 64-bit integer using 8-bit encoding per sticker.

These representations allow efficient rotation, comparison, and solver integration.

### ðŸ§® Solvers

Implemented algorithms to solve the cube:

DFS (Depth-First Search)

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

IDDFS (Iterative Deepening DFS)

IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) using pattern databases

IDA* Solver â€“ Korfâ€™s Algorithm

IDA* combines A* and IDDFS, using pattern databases as a heuristic for optimal moves.

# ðŸ–¼ Cube Scanner Instructions

Start with White face up, then Green â†’ Red â†’ Blue â†’ Orange â†’ Yellow centers.

Press 'n' to capture the next face, 'r' to rescan the current face.

Ensure good lighting for accurate scanning.

#### ðŸ—‚ Database & Pattern Files

Corner Pattern Database: Stores precomputed moves to speed up IDA* solver.

CornerDBMaker.cpp used to generate database files.

Database file example: Databases/cornerDepth5V1.txt

#### ðŸ’» Build & Run

Clone repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mokshada30/rubiks_cube_solver.git


Build with CMake in CLion or terminal.

Run the program:

./rubiks_cube_solver


Follow scanner instructions to capture the cube, then watch the solution being printed.


## How IDA* Works:

A* Algorithm: Prioritizes nodes using:

f(n) = g(n) + h(n)


g(n): Distance from start to current node

h(n): Estimated distance from current node to goal

Heuristic: Provides an estimate of distance to the solved cube. Must underestimate or match, never overestimate.

Pattern Databases:

Corner Pattern Database: Stores minimal moves to solve corners, assuming edges are solved.

Edge Pattern Database: Stores moves to solve edges (optional; not implemented here).

This project uses only the Corner Pattern Database for simplicity and efficiency.

IDA* Algorithm:

Run A* with a maximum f(n) bound.

If exceeded, prune the branch and track minimum f(n) overbound as next_bound.

Repeat A* with next_bound until the goal state is reached.
